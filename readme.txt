Speeds up and beautifies your blog by substituting the individually-wrapped WordPress smilies with a single CSS image sprite containing all emoticons.

== Description ==
Speedy Smilies takes emoticons in WordPress to the next level (where it should be already and hopefully one day will). The end goal is to make smilies load faster in the browser for visitors and make them easy to insert into posts/pages for authors. In addition to the speed benefits, Speedy Smilies allows authors to easily change the appearance of emoticons using smilie sets.

Speedy Smilies is free software licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.

== Installation ==

1. Extract `speedy-smilies.zip` and upload the resulting `speedy-smilies` directory to `wp-content/plugins/speedy-smilies`.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' section of WordPress.
1. Configure the plugin using the 'Speedy Smilies' page under the 'Appearance' section of WordPress.

== Screenshots ==

1. Here we're looking at the control panel settings page for the plugin where you can select a smilie set.
2. An editing pane allows you to insert smilies into posts and pages simply by clicking on them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I report a bug or request a feature? =

I'd love to hear your feedback. Please visit the [WordPress.org Forums for Speedy Smilies](http://wordpress.org/tags/speedy-smilies) to leave comments.

= How do I create my own smilies sets? =

As of Release 9, smilie sets are modular so you can add your own set of emoticons for use with the Speedy Smilies plugin. Each smilie set has a `.png` image and a `.php` file of the same name inside of the `sets/` directory.

At this time, there's no automated way to create the necessary PNG image and PHP file required for a smilie set, so your best bet is to learn by example. Let me know if a guided wizard to create new smilie sets is a feature that you'd like to see added in the future.

== Changelog ==

= Release 15 (7/24/2011) =
* Bug fix: CSS optimizer handles invalid selectors such as `,{` in the [Skeptical theme](http://www.woothemes.com/2010/09/skeptical/).
* Bug fix: Upgrading the plugin or deleting the cached CSS file no longer ruins your blog's layout. The CSS is automatically regenerated whenever the cached file no longer exists.

= Release 14 (7/23/2011) =
* Bug fix ([report](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-speedy-smilies-works-in-graphene-theme-but-not-in-matala)): CSS optimizer handles zero-length comments such as those in the [Matala theme](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/matala).  

= Release 13 (5/29/2011) =
* Cached files created by the [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/) and [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/) plugins are automatically cleared when Speedy Smilies regenerates the CSS.
* The admin page now displays more information about each smilie set including image dimensions and filesize.
* Added two new smilie sets (Diagona and Diagona Small).
* Added `:heart:` emoticon to existing sets Silk and Fugue.

= Release 12 (5/28/2011) =
* Added inline image embedding. When enabled, the image file will be included within the body of the CSS using a `data:` URI.

= Release 11 (5/28/2011) =
* Bug fix ([report](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-speedy-smilies-smilies-not-visible)): CSS generated by Speedy Smilies uses the `!important` declaration to prevent conflicts with style rules in your WordPress theme.

= Release 10 (11/1/2009) =
* Added contextual help option linking to the support page for Speedy Smilies.
* Bug fix: Removed extra margins when viewing the administration page in Webkit browsers.

= Release 9 (10/13/2009) =
* In addition to regenerating the cached stylesheets when you switch to another theme, Speedy Smilies automatically regenerates the cache when it detects changes in the current theme's `style.css`. For added clarity, a notification is displayed inside of the admin control panel whenever Speedy Smilies regenerates the stylesheet.
* Smilies sets are loaded dynamically instead of being hard-coded. Each smilie set has a `.png` image and a `.php` file of the same name inside of the `sets/` directory.

= Release 8 (9/30/2009) =
* Added CSS caching. Instead of dynamically generating stylesheets via style.php on each visit, stylesheets are generated only once when changing the theme or smilie set. If you are using the Apache web server, the included `.htaccess` file in the `cache/` directory automatically serves these cached CSS files with appropriate Cache-Control: and Expires: HTTP headers.

= Release 7 (9/26/2009) =
* Added a workaround for incompatible themes and plugins. When enabled, Speedy Smilies will add a second stylesheet to your blog, leaving your theme's stylesheet unchanged. The default behavior is to combine the CSS from your theme and the Speedy Smilies plugin into a single, minified CSS file.

= Release 6 (9/19/2009) =
* Bug fix: For increased security, style.php will not execute when the plugin is disabled.

= Release 5 (9/14/2009) =
* Bug fix: The plugin now makes use of the include_url() function instead and will now work properly if you've installed your blog into a subdirectory (e.g., http://yourdomain.com/blog/).

= Release 4 (9/10/2009) =
* Compatible with WordPress 2.8.4.
* Realized that style.php is executing on EVERY page load and wasn't cacheable by browsers. Oops. For the time being, we now cache style.php for 10 minutes; a better solution is forthcoming.

= Release 3 (7/15/2009) =
* Added a basic check for incompatible plugins.
* CSS is now minified as it passes through the Speedy Smilies plugin to yield faster download and rendering times for visitors.
* Improved the plugin's control panel settings page and added a sample text box to preview smilies (see screenshot).
* Added two new smilie sets (WordPress Default, in case anyone actually likes the smilies that ship with WordPress, and Moskis).

= Release 2 (7/9/2009) =
* First public release!
